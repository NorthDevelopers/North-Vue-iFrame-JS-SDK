# Embed Payments in a VueJS App

This is a JavaScript application that uses the Vue framework and Node.js to demonstrate an embedded payment solution with [Payments Hub's iFrame JavaScript SDK](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/card-not-present/iframe-javascript-sdk). The full-stack code in this repository adds a simple payment form to a website, handling both the front-end and back-end aspects of the payment process.

## Get Sandbox Credentials

To get started, create a free [Payments Hub Developer Portal account](https://developer.paymentshub.com/auth/signup). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. Check out the official [iFrame JavaScript SDK Integration Guide](https://developer.paymentshub.com/products/card-not-present/iframe-javascript-sdk/integration), then [contact](https://developer.paymentshub.com/contact) the Payments Hub Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
